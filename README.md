## Time Zone

The time zone of the review deadline is according to the OJS.
This setting is defined in the `config.inc.php` file, in the `time_zone` field.

## Configure the One-click Reviewer Access

If it is not already enabled, you can go to `Workflow > Review > Setup` to enable a secure link in the email invitation to reviewers. This will allow the reviewer to receive a direct link to the assigned review.
